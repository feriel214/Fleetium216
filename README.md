# Description 
This project is a real-time vehicle tracking system dedicated to fleet management, but can also be used by individual users. The system offers real-time tracking, monitoring vehicle's performance, and diagnostics using the Ulbotech T381 device. It allows fleet managers to track their vehicles in real-time, set up geofences to receive alerts when a vehicle enters or exits a specific area, and receive notifications for various events such as over-speeding, harsh braking, and engine faults.

The system is designed as a final year project with a focus on fleet management, which can help businesses and organizations to improve their fleet operations, optimize routes, monitor driver behavior, and reduce operational costs. The project utilizes the Ulbotech T381 device to obtain real-time vehicle data, including location, speed, fuel consumption, and engine health. The data is transmitted to a cloud-based server, which can be accessed via a web interface or a mobile application.

The project is developed using modern software development practices and technologies such as : **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Vue.js, Express.js, Azure Table Storage, PostgreSQL and Git**. The system is designed to be scalable, modular, and extensible, allowing for easy integration with other systems and devices.

This project is a comprehensive vehicle tracking system that offers multiple modules to enhance the user experience. The system is designed to allow users to track, monitor and manage their vehicles in real-time using the Ulbotech T381 device.


The system offers the following key modules:

## Geofence Module
This module allows the customer to draw a geographic virtual zone on the provided map and then add the cars into it. This feature is designed to help users set up virtual boundaries, allowing them to receive alerts when a vehicle enters or exits a specific area.

</p>

## Live Data Module
This module allows the user to view real-time data of the cars and their details. Users can monitor their vehicles' locations, speed, fuel consumption, and engine health in real-time. The live data module is designed to help users identify any issues with their vehicles in real-time and take immediate action to resolve them.

## Scoring Module
This module offers a user interface that enables the customer to calculate the score of the car entered and view different charts related to the score results. The scoring module is designed to help users monitor the behavior of their drivers and provide them with insights into how to improve their driving.

## Dashboard Module
This module allows the user to view a full report with charts about all the cars. Users can access a dashboard with charts and graphs that provide them with insights into their vehicles' performance and behavior. The dashboard module is designed to help users make data-driven decisions to optimize their fleet's performance and reduce operational costs.
